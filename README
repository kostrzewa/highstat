"highstat" is a set of R scripts for the analysis of high statistics runs
generated with the tmLQCD software package

plotexpvals is a function which uses Carsten Urbach's hadron library
to compute expectation values of the plaquette and the rectangle
for the set of sample files of the tmLQCD software package
under the hood it also computes the optimal autocorrelation time
accoring to U. Wollf's method

it produces three plots for each sample file, one for the plaquette expectation value
the second for the rectangle expectation value (unless it contains no rectangle gauge
contribution) and the third for the plaquette history (100 trajectories)

the argument "topdir" must be the path to a directory which contains
a set of subdirectories
these subdirectories in turn relate to different runs of the different
sample input files
each subdirectory must contain "output.data" for the given run

the names of the subdirectories should begin with the strings in the 
"samples" vector (see plotexpvals.R)

"norectsamples" is a subset of samples which do not contain a rectangle
contribution in their gauge action (see plotexpvals.R)

example directory structure
topdir
|
-----> hmc0_old_serial
|  |-> hmc0_new_serial 
|  |-> hmc0_old_mpi
|  |-> hmc0_new_mpi
|
-----> hmc1_[...]
[...] 

because of the way that the subfunctions are called this should be run
in the directory containing the R files
